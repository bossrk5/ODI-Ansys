/COM,ANSYS RELEASE Release 17.0      BUILD 17.0      UP20151214       12:32:57

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       5.328   TIME= 12:56:50
 Structural elements without mid nodes usually produce much more         
 accurate results in quad or brick shape.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.703   TIME= 13:04:08
 The requested number of modes is reduced from 10 to 9 since there are   
 only 9 degrees of freedom in the model.
